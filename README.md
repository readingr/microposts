# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: sample app

This is the sample application for the [Ruby on Rails Tutorial](http://railstutorial.org/) by [Michael Hartl](http://michaelhartl.com/).

This application has been made provenance aware by [Richard Reading](http://github.com/readingr/), and it shows a proof of concept for provenance on the web. To demonstrate this, it can be used in conjunction with the [provenance data repositoryy](http://github.com/readingr/provenance), it has been modified to allow for:

	-replying of posts
	-remote posting
	-retrieving of posts externally
